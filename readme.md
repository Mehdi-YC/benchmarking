# this is a repo for programming languages benchmarking

## speed is not the only thing we need in a language but...

we can not deny that we all want to see what lang is more speedy/suitable for a situation , i work generally in python , it is not the fastest one here but it gets my job done
but sometimes i just want to switch over to julia , go or node to see if i can work with it so i run benchmarks for :

1 - obviously see th eproformance
2 - be more familiar with a language (im not fane with verbouse ones like java or c#)
